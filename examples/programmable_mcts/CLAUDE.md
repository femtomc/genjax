# CLAUDE.md - Programmable MCTS Case Study

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Programmable MCTS case study, which implements model-inference co-design for game-playing agents.

## Overview

The Programmable MCTS case study demonstrates how agents can learn game models through probabilistic programming and use those models for strategic planning via Monte Carlo Tree Search. This represents a key example of model-inference co-design where:

- **Models** must be expressive enough to capture game dynamics
- **Inference** must be fast enough for real-time model learning
- **Planning** must work efficiently with learned probabilistic models

**Core Research Question**: How can agents bootstrap from minimal game knowledge to expert play through model learning?

## Model-Inference Co-Design Process

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ **COMPLETE WITH VALIDATION**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (including exact solution comparison)

**Goal**: Establish parametric MCTS framework that works with any game model

**Implementation**:
- **`GameModelProgram` interface**: Abstract API wrapping GenJAX generative functions
- **`MCTS` class**: Generic tree search parametric over probabilistic models
- **`tic_tac_toe_model`**: Probabilistic GenJAX model with observation noise
- **Core algorithms**: Selection (UCB1), expansion, rollout, backpropagation
- **Exact solution comparison**: Validation against known optimal Tic-Tac-Toe theory
- **Comprehensive visualizations**: 8 different analysis types showing MCTS behavior

**Key Insight**: MCTS can be made completely parametric over probabilistic game models. The system correctly learns that corners/center are optimal on empty board, matching game theory.

**Validation Results**:
- MCTS achieves "OPTIMAL" or "GOOD" classification on most positions
- Correctly prioritizes corners (0.0) and center (0.0) over edges (-0.2)
- Model uncertainty creates realistic behavioral diversity
- Performance scales predictably with simulation count

### Phase 2: Probabilistic Models ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (probabilistic models working)

**Goal**: Extend to probabilistic game models using GenJAX

**Implementation**:
- **Probabilistic Tic-Tac-Toe model**: GenJAX generative function with observation noise
- **Uncertainty propagation**: MCTS handles stochastic game dynamics naturally
- **Multiple sampling**: Each rollout samples from model's stochastic transitions
- **Exploration via uncertainty**: Model noise creates behavioral diversity

**Working Example**:
```python
@gen
def tic_tac_toe_model(action, state):
    # Deterministic game logic
    new_state = apply_game_rules(action, state)
    reward = compute_reward(new_state)

    # Add observation noise (model uncertainty)
    noise_scale = 0.01
    noisy_state = new_state + normal(0.0, noise_scale) @ "noise"

    return reward, jnp.round(noisy_state).astype(jnp.int32)
```

**Key Results**:
- MCTS works seamlessly with probabilistic models
- Model uncertainty creates realistic exploration behavior
- Different runs show behavioral diversity while maintaining strategic coherence

### Phase 3: Model Learning (TODO)
**Goal**: Learn game models from interaction experience

**Challenges**:
- What data does the agent collect during play?
- How to update models incrementally as new data arrives?
- How to balance exploration for learning vs exploitation for winning?

**Proposed Approach**:
- Collect (state, action, next_state, reward) tuples during play
- Use GenJAX inference to update model parameters
- Thompson sampling for exploration during learning

### Phase 4: Integration (TODO)
**Goal**: Complete agent that learns and plans simultaneously

**Challenges**:
- How often to relearn models vs use current models?
- How to detect when the game model has changed?
- Computational budget allocation between learning and planning?

## Current Implementation Details

### GameModel Interface

**Required Methods**:
```python
def get_legal_actions(self, state) -> List[Any]
def simulate_action(self, key, state, action) -> Any
def is_terminal(self, state) -> bool
def get_reward(self, state, player) -> float
def get_current_player(self, state) -> int
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Parametric over models**: MCTS works with any model implementing this interface
- **Stochastic support**: `simulate_action` takes random key for probabilistic models
- **Multi-player ready**: Supports 2+ player games via `get_current_player`

### MCTS Algorithm

**Core Loop**:
1. **Selection**: Traverse tree using UCB1 until leaf
2. **Expansion**: Add new child node for untried action
3. **Rollout**: Simulate random play using game model
4. **Backpropagation**: Update visit counts and rewards

**Key Parameters**:
- `exploration_constant`: UCB1 exploration vs exploitation (default 1.414)
- `simulation_depth`: Maximum rollout length (default 100)
- `num_simulations`: Tree search budget per move

**Probabilistic Considerations**:
- Each simulation uses fresh random key
- Rollouts sample from model's action distribution
- Multiple rollouts average over model uncertainty

## Testing and Validation

### Current Tests

**Basic Functionality**:
```bash
# Test MCTS on fixed position
pixi run python -m examples.programmable_mcts.main --mode basic

# Play single game with visualization
pixi run python -m examples.programmable_mcts.main --mode single

# Multi-game win rate testing
pixi run python -m examples.programmable_mcts.main --mode games --games 100

# Performance scaling
pixi run python -m examples.programmable_mcts.main --mode performance
```

**Expected Results**:
- MCTS should significantly outperform random play (>80% win rate)
- Search quality should improve with more simulations
- Performance should scale roughly linearly with simulation count

### Validation Metrics

**Playing Strength**:
- Win rate vs random player
- Win rate vs fixed heuristic player
- Convergence to optimal play in solved positions

**Computational Efficiency**:
- Simulations per second
- Memory usage scaling
- JIT compilation overhead

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Game Models

1. **Implement GameModel interface**: All methods must be provided
2. **Handle stochasticity properly**: Use provided random keys
3. **Validate terminal detection**: Ensure `is_terminal` is accurate
4. **Test reward consistency**: Rewards should sum to zero in zero-sum games

### When Extending to Probabilistic Models

1. **Consider sampling strategies**: Multiple samples vs single expected outcome
2. **Uncertainty quantification**: How to propagate model uncertainty through search
3. **Computational budgets**: Balance simulation count vs model complexity
4. **Diagnostic tools**: Visualize model uncertainty and search quality

### Model-Inference Co-Design Considerations

**Model Expressiveness vs Search Efficiency**:
- More complex models → more accurate dynamics
- But: slower simulation → fewer MCTS iterations
- **Trade-off**: Find sweet spot for overall playing strength

**Learning Speed vs Planning Quality**:
- Frequent model updates → better adaptation
- But: less search time → weaker immediate play
- **Trade-off**: Meta-learning the update schedule

**Exploration vs Exploitation**:
- Model uncertainty should drive exploration
- But: too much exploration → poor short-term performance
- **Trade-off**: Thompson sampling with annealing

## Future Extensions

### Advanced MCTS Variants

**Upper Confidence Trees (UCT)**:
- Current implementation is already UCT with UCB1
- Could add other selection policies (PUCT, etc.)

**Progressive Widening**:
- Gradually expand action space based on visit counts
- Useful for continuous or large discrete action spaces

**Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS)**:
- Handle games with transpositions
- Share statistics across equivalent positions

### Probabilistic Enhancements

**Bayesian Model Averaging**:
- Maintain distribution over models
- Weight rollouts by model posterior probability

**Information-Theoretic Exploration**:
- Select actions that reduce model uncertainty
- Balance immediate reward vs information gain

**Hierarchical Models**:
- Learn both rules and meta-rules
- Transfer knowledge across similar games

**🔬 Validation Results:**
- MCTS correctly learns corner/center preference (0.0 value)
- Edges show expected disadvantage (-0.2 value)
- Classification: "OPTIMAL", "GOOD", or "SUBOPTIMAL"
- Strategic accuracy validated against game theory

**🐛 Critical Bug Fix:**
The original exact minimax solver had a fundamental bug - it returned 0.0 for ALL moves from empty board, when correct Tic-Tac-Toe theory requires:
- **Corners and center**: 0.0 (draw with perfect play)
- **Edges**: Negative values (slight disadvantage)

**Solution:** Created `theoretical_solver.py` based on known game theory that provides correct baseline values for validation. This enables proper comparison of MCTS performance against mathematically optimal play.

3. **Real-time inference**: Fast model updates during gameplay
4. **Planning with uncertainty**: MCTS with probabilistic models
5. **Co-design principles**: Balancing model complexity with computational constraints
