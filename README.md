## What is GenJAX?

### **Probabilistic Programming Language**

GenJAX is a probabilistic programming language (PPL): a system which provides automation for writing programs which perform computations on probability distributions, including sampling, variational approximation, gradient estimation for expected values, and more.

### **With Programmable Inference** 

The design of GenJAX is centered on _programmable inference_: automation which allows users to express and customize Bayesian inference algorithms (algorithms for computing with posterior distributions: "_x_ affects _y_, and I observe _y_, what are my new beliefs about _x_?"). Programmable inference includes advanced forms of Monte Carlo and variational inference methods.

### **Core Concepts**

GenJAX's automation is based on two key concepts:
- **_Generative functions_** â€“ GenJAX's version of probabilistic programs
- **_Traces_** â€“ samples from probabilistic programs

GenJAX provides:

- **Modeling language automation** for constructing complex probability distributions from pieces
- **Inference automation** for constructing Monte Carlo samplers using convenient idioms (programs expressed by creating and editing traces), and [variational inference automation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3656463) using [new extensions to automatic differentation for expected values](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3571198)

### **Fully Vectorized & Compatible with JAX**

All of GenJAX's automation is fully compatible with JAX, implying that any program written in GenJAX can be `vmap`'d and `jit` compiled.

## ðŸ¤– Using Claude Code with GenJAX

This repository is optimized for development with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Anthropic's AI coding assistant. The codebase includes comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` files that provide context and guidance for Claude Code to work effectively with GenJAX.
